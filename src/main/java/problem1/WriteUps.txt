I used the builder pattern for all objects with more than 3 fields, such as Driver, DriverLicence, Vehicle.
Because if we have multiple consecutive arguments of the same type, it's easy to accidentally swap them around.
In addition, adding more constructor parameters results in code that becomes harder to read.
